# Detecting-phishing-websites-using-ML

This project is based on a problem mentioned in the Goa Police Hackathon 2024, where the objective was to detect and categorize websites as phishing or legitimate. While we didn't participate in the hackathon, we took this topic and worked on it independently to build a machine learning model to classify websites.
